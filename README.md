## My colleges' EDI Project

This is a simple crypto currency portfolio management site made using react and firebase, where you can:
<ul>
  <li>Add new coins to track 🪙</li>
  <li>See basic profit and loss 📈📉</li>
  <li>See the price graph 📊</li>
  <li>Some more metrics along with that</li>
  <li>And I dont know, maybe i'll add some, maybe I'llremove some...</li>
  <li>Only time🕒 and college🎓 deadline will tell that💀</li>
  <li>For time being responsiveness is not given much importance</li>
</ul>
  

wont run out of the box as, firebase credentials🔑 aren't in this repo : )

Still underdevelopment...👨‍💻
