## My colleges' EDI Project

This is a simple crypto currency portfolio management site made using react and firebase, where you can:
<ul>
  <li>Add new coins to track 🪙</li>
  <li>See basic profit and loss 📈📉</li>
  <li>See the price graph 📊</li>
  <li>Some more metrics along with that</li>
  <li>And I dont know, maybe i'll add some, maybe I'llremove some...</li>
  <li>Only time🕒 and college🎓 deadline will tell that💀</li>
  <li>For time being responsiveness is not given much importance</li>
</ul>

Things to keep in mind:
<ul>
  <li>Exchange rates are based on USDT</li>
  <li>In order to contribute please transpile the SCSS first
    <ul>
      <li>Transpile once - `yarn/npm run transpileSCSS`</li>
      <li>Watch - `yarn/npm run watchSCSS`</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

wont run out of the box as, firebase credentials🔑 aren't in this repo : )

Still underdevelopment...👨‍💻
